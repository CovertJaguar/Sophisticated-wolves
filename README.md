What is Sophisticated Wolves? It's a mod that aims to improve wolves in the games through a series of gameplay tweaks, AI improvements, and added features. The focus is not to have overpowered items or crazy abilities, but rather balanced additions that make sense in the world of MC. Essentially, wolves should be able to better respond to your actions and take care of themselves, so you don't have to consider them a liability when mining, exploring or fighting.

This is an updated and reworked version of [metroidfood](http://www.minecraftforum.net/members/metroidfood)'s ["Sophisticated Wolves"](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1276521) mod.
